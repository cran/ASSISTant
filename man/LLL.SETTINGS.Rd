\title{Design and trial settings used in the Lai, Lavori, Liao paper simulations}
\description{
A list of design and trial design settings used for analysis and simulations in
the Lai, Lavori, Liao paper displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The
elements of the list are the following
\describe{
  \item{trialParameters}{
    \describe{
     \item{N}{the sample size at each of three interim looks, the last being the final one;
              The length of this also determines the number of interim looks}
     \item{type1Error}{the overall type I error}
     \item{eps}{the fraction of type I error spent at each interim look}
     \item{type2Error}{the type II error desired}
    }
  }
  \item{scenarios}{
    A list of the 10 settings used in the simulations named \code{S0}, \code{S1}, ...,
    \code{S10} as in the paper, each with three elements
    \describe{
     \item{mean}{a \eqn{2\times J} matrix of means, the first row for the null setting,
                 the second for the alternative}
     \item{sd}{a \eqn{2\times J} matrix of standard deviations, the first row for the
               null setting, the second for the alternative}
    }
  }
  \item{prevalences}{
    A list of two elements with prevalence vectors used in the paper; the lengths of these
    vectors implicitly define the number of groups.
    \describe{
     \item{table1}{a vector of equal prevalences for six groups used in table 1}
     \item{table2}{a vector of prevalences used in table 2 of the paper}
    }
  }
}
